This is pedagogical Jupyter notebook file that computes the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in canonical single field inflationary scenarios that include a transient phase of non-attractor era required for the amplification of the spectrum. 

For the purpose described above, the background an effective parametrization of the background evolution is provided following arXiv: XXXX.XXXX. Around this background solution, we then solve the Mukhanov-Sasaki (MS) equation for each mode in Fourier space which is essential in computiong the power spectrum of scalar fluctuations during inflation. 

The program can be generalized to user defined scalar potentials by adding an initial section that solves the background equations followed by defining the relevant background / slow-roll parameters required for the solution of the MS equation.
